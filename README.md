# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is my final project for Introduction to Deep Learning.

# The Problem to Solve
The project can be narrowed down to a NLP case where we want to predict the genre of a book from a summary. In this case I used the Kaggle user Atjarva Inamdar [Book Genre Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athu1105/book-genre-prediction?datasetId=2482107) dataset which is recently new and looks clean which is good for the main focus of the project.

# The Code
This is a Jupyter Notebook which was created through the Kaggle Kernel with GPU acceleration, if you want to replicate it I recommend you use the same kernel with the enhancement.

For this project I used the Keras with Tensorflow frontend to build the neural networks from scratch and additionally add some of the suggested Keras website tutorials referenced within the notebook to see how my proposals fare.

I hope this projects helps you understand more about NLP and the improtance of certain steps of the process.

Any feedback to improve this report is appreciated, hope you found the resources within this repo useful.
